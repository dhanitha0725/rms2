## üåü Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Adheres to clean architecture principles, promoting separation of concerns and scalability.
- **CQRS + Mediator Pattern**: Implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with the Mediator pattern for better request handling.
- **Result Pattern**: Ensures consistent and predictable outcomes for operations, improving error handling and success reporting.
- **FluentAPI Database Configuration**: Utilizes FluentAPI for precise and flexible database configurations.
- **Validation**: Implements **FluentValidation** for robust and reusable validation logic for commands and queries.
- **Structured Logging**: Integrated with Serilog and Seq Server for detailed and structured logging.
- **Transactional Consistency**: Uses the Unit of Work pattern to maintain atomicity in transactions.
- **Dependency Injection**: Fully leverages .NET's built-in dependency injection and custom service registrations for loosely coupled and testable code.
- **Secure Authentication**: Built with .NET Identity for robust authentication and user management.
- **Background Jobs**: Supports background task execution using `IHostedService`.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Middleware for centralized exception handling, ensuring consistent error responses.

## ‚ú® Architecture Highlights

### 1. Clean Architecture
- Ensures separation of concerns, making the codebase highly maintainable.
- Promotes testability and scalability.

### 2. CQRS + Mediator
- Segregates read and write operations for improved performance and scalability.
- Utilizes the Mediator pattern to decouple request handling and ensure clear separation of concerns.

### 3. Result Pattern
- Provides a unified structure for returning operation results.
- Handles both success and failure scenarios predictably, improving robustness and maintainability.

### 4. Data Access
- Follows the **Repository Pattern** for encapsulating database logic.
- Implements the **Unit of Work Pattern** to ensure transactional consistency.
- Configures the database using **FluentAPI** for precise and flexible schema definitions.

### 5. DTO Mapping
- Combines **AutoMapper** and manual mapping for precise and efficient data transfer.

### 6. Validation
- Uses **FluentValidation** for robust and reusable validation logic across the application.

### 7. Dependency Injection
- Fully leverages .NET's built-in dependency injection mechanism.
- Includes custom dependency injection modules for services, repositories, and external integrations (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, MailKit).

### 8. Logging and Monitoring
- Integrated with **Serilog** for structured logging.
- Supports external logging sinks such as **Seq Server** for advanced monitoring and analysis.

### 9. Background Processing
- Implements background job execution using `IHostedService` for handling periodic tasks.

### 10. Middleware
- Custom middleware for global exception handling ensures consistent and user-friendly error responses.
